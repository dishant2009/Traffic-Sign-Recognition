# Traffic Sign Detection & Recognition
The German Traffic Sign Benchmark is a multi-class, single-image classification challenge held at the International Joint Conference on Neural Networks (IJCNN) 2011.
In this project I have developed a model which can detect and recognise traffic sign from live video feed.
